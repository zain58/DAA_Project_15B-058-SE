inventory planning
The Rinky Dink Company makes machines that resurface ice rinks. The demand for such products varies from month to month, and so the company needs to develop a strategy to plan its manufacturing given the fluctuating, but predictable, demand. The company wishes to design a plan for the next n months. For each month i, the company knows the demand di, that is, the number of machines that it will sell. Let D = ?ni=1 (di) be the total demand over the next n months.

The company keeps a full-time staff who provide labor to manufacture up to m machines per month. If the company needs to make more than m machines in a given month, it can hire additional, part-time labor, at a cost that works out to c dollars per machine. Furthermore, if, at the end of a month, the company is holding any unsold machines, it must pay inventory costs. The cost for holding j machines is given as a function h(j) for j = 1,2,...,D, where h(j) >= 0 for 1 <= j <= D and h(j) <= h(j+1) for 1 <= j <= D-1.

this is a python code it will run on pycharm software.
